The ward was extremely dark, and it was quiet all around. A girl was lying on the hospital bed tossing and turning, she couldn't sleep, and her headaches tortured her. The girl really wanted to find someone to chat and pass the long and lonely night. Inadvertently, her hand touched the bedside table. She immediately thought that just today when an uncle came to the hospital to visit her, he brought a teddy bear. That little bear's fluffy look is very cute. By the way, the uncle said that this little bear can tell stories. is that true? The girl couldn't restrain her curiosity, and fumbled with her hand on the bedside table. She wanted to find the little bear and let it accompany her.
