The ward was extremely dark, and it was quiet all around. A girl was lying on the hospital bed tossing and turning, she couldn't sleep, and her headaches tortured her. The girl really wanted to find someone to chat and pass the long and lonely night. Inadvertently, her hand touched the bedside table. She immediately thought that just today when an uncle came to the hospital to visit her, he brought a teddy bear. That little bear's fluffy look is very cute. By the way, the uncle said that this little bear can tell stories. is that true? The girl couldn't restrain her curiosity, and fumbled with her hand on the bedside table. She wanted to find the little bear and let it accompany her.

As she searched for the teddy bear with no other senses but the feel of her own hand, she finally located the teddy bear, soft and cuddly as she had hoped. She then asked the teddy bear if it could tell a bedtime story to help her fall asleep.

The teddy bear did not speak, for it is a teddy bear. The girl cried herself to sleep that night, but when she awoke she saw her uncle sitting next to her bed. She asked him why the teddy bear could not speak. He answered "the only teddy bear that speaks is ted, and ted's stories are not appropriate for you". The girl started crying, so the uncle told her a story of his own. By the end of the story, the little girl was asleep in his lap.
